		<h2>Summary of my favorite short story</h2>
		<p>meet me at happy hour... By Almost Friday TV</p>
		<br />
		<p style="background-color: white;">Chet and Will meet blackout drunk at a bar, and have a night of wild and regrettable decisions. These two characters build their friendship throughout the night, and at the end when they find themselves at a rooftop, Will says, "I think you're my best friend.". Chet's reaction to this sends them down a spiral. "We aren't friends... but we are right now." The clash of the characters present drunken state is in danger to their soon to be sober state. Chet believes that when he wakes up and he's hungover, he's gonna regret everything he did the night previous. "This has been the best night of my life, and if I remember it, then I'll regret it." </p>
